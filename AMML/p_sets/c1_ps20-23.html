				In our later work, three facts about inequalities will be crucial. Although proofs will be supplied at the appropriate point in the text, a personal assault on these problems is infinitely more enlightening than a perusal of a completely worked-out proof. The statements of these propositions involve some weird numbers, but their basic message is simple: if $x$ is close enough to $x_0,$ and $y$ is close enough to $y_0,$ then $x+y$ will be close to $x_0+y_0,$ and $xy$ will be close to $x_0y_0,$ and $1/y$ will be close to $1/y_0.$ The symbol "$\varepsilon$" which appears in these propositions is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet ("epsilon"), and could just as well be replaced by a less intimidating Roman letter; however, tradition has made the use of $\varepsilon$ sacrosanct in the contexts to which these theorems apply.

	            (The notation "min" was defined in Problem 13, but the formula provided by that problem is irrelevent at the moment; the first inequality in the hypothesis just means that

	            $$
	            at one point in the argument you will need the first inequality, and at another point you will need the second. One more word of advice: since the hypotheses only provide information about $x-x_0$ and $y-y_0,$ it is almost a foregone conclusion that the proof will depend upon writing $xy-x_0y_0$ in a way that involves $x-x_0$ and $y-y_0.$)

		        	This problem is trivial in the sense that its solution follows from Problem 21 and 22 with almost no work at all (notice that $x/y=x \cdot 1/y$). The crucial point is not to become confused; decide which of the two problems should be used first, and don't panic if your answer looks unlikely.
