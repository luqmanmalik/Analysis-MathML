## Calculus
### 4E Problem Sets &#9634; Michael Spivak
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

__Calculus__ is the first installment in the eight–part analysis sequence by mathematician and author Michael Spivak. __CLC_FE__, therefore, is the first installment in my corresponding eight–part solution sequence.

__Part V (Epilogue)__ of the book concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. I use this method to explore a forking of the Peano–Dedekind construction of **N** with extensions to **&real;** that revisits some fundamental assumptions about (0, &inf;). In doing so, I am considering the arguments of Weierstrass/Spivak, and Robinson's **NA**.

__Required tech()__ All of my repositories are Safari–centric. Given the simplex design of the page–frame (HTML_CSS, MathJax) versus the complex embedding of the carousel<sup>4</sup> main–frame (JS, PHP, c++), a browser–universal repository seems exessive and idyllic at this stage.

**Copyrighting** dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone and_or fork of each version of the source, a well–defined attribution ecology is formed within the repository's geneological record. Furthermore, by compiling the metadata of each version>clone>fork, one can analize the structural distance of that copy from the source. Therefore, [repo + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::autr(s_code).
