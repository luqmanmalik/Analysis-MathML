These are my solutions to the text. That is to say, what is written here I have written myself. **Part V: Epilogue** concludes with chapters on the construction of the real numbers, and a demonstration of the uniqueness of the real numbers. As a bit of "original" contemplation, I offer some remarks on the Peano–Dedekind construction of **N** with the aim of expanding that set of arguments to **R** via **PV** of this text.

Copywrighting dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone a/o fork of each version of the source, a well–defined copywright ecology is formed within the repository's historical record. Furthermore, by compiling the unique metadata of each version>clone>fork its structural distance from the source can be measured and evaluated. Therefore, [local_contribut_data + metadata(repo) + License]–**authenticate**–S_code(author).
